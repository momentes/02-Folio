Bootcamp Module 02 Challenge - Create a web application Folio Page

This assignment code is to help student to find work by displaying their work as well as their thought process behind it. Note : several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies

**The acceptance criteria is as follow :**
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

**Creator Note:**
1. CSS and HTML has been commented. I do find commenting codes by section much more helpful than semantics for a beginner me atm.
2. Semantics elements has only been use to define 'Sections / Paragraph of Body'
3. Image alt may not be the best description and or has not been fill-up completely. 
4. The creation started with a strong body and throughout the learning process from other resources I pick up things that made it work.
5. I find the .class was the most suitable references of my coding style/familiarity for this assignment
6. At the time of coding still learning about what goes after Body, Section, ... div? ul? li? div seems to be widely used everywhere.
7. This was done to also done in part for my an enjoyable/amusement experience to be seen by family & friends over Christmas 2022
8. I am part of the Design Team on the W Hotel in Melbourne.
