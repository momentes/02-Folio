This assignment code is to help student to find work by displaying their work as well as their thought process behind it. Note : several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies

**The acceptance criteria is as follow :**
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

**Creator Note:**
1. CSS and HTML has been commented
2. Semantics elements has only been use to define 'Sections / Paragraph of Body'
3. Image alt may not be the best description and or has not been fill-up completely.
4. The creation started with a strong body and throughout the learning process from other resources I pick up things that made it work.
5. I find the .class was the most suitable references of my coding style/familiarity for this assignment
